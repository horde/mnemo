The Mnemo Note Manager is the Horde notes/memos application. It allows
users to keep web-based notes and freeform text. Notes may be shared
with other users via shared notepads. It requires the Horde Application
Framework and an SQL database or Kolab server for backend storage.

This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software. OSI Certified is a
